# Bedtime Fading

## What it is

Bedtime fading is a behavioral sleep intervention that works by temporarily moving bedtime **later** — to match the time when your baby naturally falls asleep — and then gradually shifting it earlier once sleep onset becomes quick and consistent.

The idea: if bedtime is at 7pm but your baby never falls asleep before 8:30pm, you're spending 90 minutes of frustrated crying and re-settling. Bedtime fading says: start at 8:30pm (when they're genuinely sleepy), achieve fast sleep onset, then move it back by 15 minutes every 2–3 nights.

**Suitable age range:** 4 months and older. Research on this method includes babies from 6–16 months.

<KeyIdea>
  Bedtime fading works with your baby's natural sleep pressure (homeostatic drive) rather than against it. You're not forcing sleep — you're timing bedtime for when sleep is most likely to happen.

## Implementation

**Step 1: Find the actual sleep window**
Observe for 3–5 nights. Note what time your baby typically falls asleep (not when you put them down). This is your starting bedtime.

**Step 2: Set the new bedtime**
Put your baby down at their natural fall-asleep time. Use your usual settling approach (whatever you're comfortable with). The goal: baby falls asleep within 15–20 minutes.

**Step 3: Maintain a consistent wake time**
Keep the morning wake time consistent — this drives sleep pressure for the next night.

**Step 4: Move bedtime earlier**
Once your baby is falling asleep within 15–20 minutes reliably for 2–3 nights, move bedtime 15 minutes earlier. Continue until you reach your desired bedtime.

  If you're exhausted from long bedtime battles, try starting bedtime 30–45 minutes later tonight. If your baby falls asleep faster, you've identified the beginning of their natural sleep window.

**If bedtime falls too late:**
Some families find the natural sleep time is very late (10pm or later). This is common in newborns and in families with later schedules. Bedtime fading still works — it just takes more gradual steps.

## What research says

In the 2016 RCT by Gradisar et al., bedtime fading was compared to graduated extinction and a control group:

- **Both behavioral interventions** (bedtime fading and graduated extinction) were equally effective at improving infant sleep
- Bedtime fading produced improvements in sleep onset latency, night wakings, and parental wellbeing
- **No evidence of harm** — no differences in stress hormones, attachment security, or emotional/behavioral development at 12-month follow-up
- Parents in the bedtime fading group reported high satisfaction with the approach

<KeyIdea>
  Bedtime fading is sometimes considered the "gentler" of the two behavioral interventions, because it doesn't involve scheduled crying periods. However, the research does not show that one approach is more harmful than the other.
</KeyIdea>

## Pros & cons

**Potential benefits:**
- No scheduled crying intervals
- Works with natural sleep biology
- Can feel more intuitive for many parents
- Evidence supports effectiveness

**Potential drawbacks:**
- Requires 2–3 weeks of observation and gradual shifting (slower than graduated extinction)
- Late bedtime may not fit family schedule initially
- Requires consistent wake time, which may be harder if family schedule varies
- Some babies resist any settling approach during the transition

<SeekHelp>
  As with any sleep approach, pause during illness, major transitions, or if you have developmental concerns. Always check with your pediatrician if your baby has health conditions that might affect sleep.
