# Graduated Extinction

## What it is

Graduated extinction (commonly called the "Ferber method") involves putting your baby down drowsy but awake, leaving the room, and checking in at gradually increasing intervals if they cry. The goal is to give your baby the opportunity to learn to fall asleep independently, with parental reassurance available at intervals.

**Suitable age range:** Most research on this method involves babies 6–18 months. It is generally not recommended before 4–6 months.

<KeyIdea>
  "Extinction" in behavioral terms simply means allowing a behavior (crying for parental response) to diminish over time. It does not mean ignoring your baby's needs.
</KeyIdea>

## Implementation

1. **Establish a consistent bedtime routine** (20–30 minutes): bath, feeding, book, song
2. **Put baby down drowsy but awake** in their sleep space
3. Say goodnight and leave the room
4. If baby cries, **wait for the first interval** (e.g., 3 minutes)
5. **Brief check-in:** 1–2 minutes maximum, calm and neutral tone. No picking up (or minimal picking up)
6. **Leave and wait the next interval** (e.g., 5 minutes, then 10 minutes)
7. Continue until baby falls asleep — **intervals increase over successive nights**

Typical interval schedule (one common version):
- Night 1: 3, 5, 10 minutes
- Night 2: 5, 10, 12 minutes
- Night 3: 10, 12, 15 minutes

  Before starting, make sure your baby's last feed is part of the routine but not the sleep onset trigger. Move the feed to before the bath if needed.

## What research says

A 2016 randomized controlled trial (Gradisar et al.) compared graduated extinction, bedtime fading, and a sleep education control group.

**Findings:**
- Both behavioral interventions reduced infant sleep problems
- **No evidence** of negative effects on infant stress hormones (cortisol)
- **No evidence** of adverse effects on parent-child attachment at 12 months
- **No evidence** of long-term emotional or behavioral problems
- Parents in the behavioral intervention groups reported significantly more sleep

<KeyIdea>
  The research does not support the claim that graduated extinction causes lasting stress or harms attachment. The evidence shows no measured harm and clear benefit to family sleep.
</KeyIdea>

This does not mean the method is "best" for every family — individual values and baby temperament matter. A neutral, evidence-informed approach is important.

## Pros & cons

**Potential benefits:**
- Strong evidence base for effectiveness
- Results often seen within 3–7 nights
- Parental check-ins provide reassurance (for parent and baby)

**Potential drawbacks:**
- Requires consistency — inconsistent implementation can make it harder
- Can be distressing for parents during the process
- Not appropriate for all temperaments or family situations
- Requires a safe, separate sleep space

<SeekHelp>
  Do not attempt sleep training if your baby is unwell, going through a major transition (new home, new caregiver), or if you have concerns about their health or development.
