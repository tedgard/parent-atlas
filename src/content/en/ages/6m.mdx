## What you may see

<div className="quick-only">

- Sits with support; some start to sit independently
- Rolls both ways
- Brings objects to mouth — ready to explore food textures
- Babbles (ba, ma, da)
- Recognizes familiar faces and responds to name
- May show early signs of stranger anxiety

</div>

<div className="deep-only">

At 6 months, babies are entering a period of rapid social, motor, and cognitive development. The **CDC 6-month milestones** include rolling in both directions, bearing weight on legs when supported, and beginning to babble with consonant sounds.

Many babies this age are also experiencing a **sleep regression** — this is often related to new developmental leaps rather than a feeding issue. Night wakings that had consolidated may return temporarily.

</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">

- Total: 12–16 hours/day (including 2–3 naps)
- Many babies can sleep a longer stretch (5–6+ hours) at night
- Sleep regressions around 6 months are common
- Sleep associations formed earlier may intensify now

<TryTonight>
  If your baby wakes at night, try pausing for 1–2 minutes before responding. This brief pause gives them a chance to resettle on their own.
</TryTonight>

<div className="deep-only">

**Self-settling** becomes more developmentally possible around 4–6 months as babies' sleep architecture matures. However, there's a wide range of normal — some babies continue to need support to fall asleep until much later.

If you're considering introducing more sleep independence, behavioral sleep interventions have been studied in randomized controlled trials. A 2016 RCT (Gradisar et al.) found that graduated extinction and bedtime fading reduced infant sleep problems and **showed no evidence of long-term adverse effects** on infant stress, attachment, or emotional/behavioral development.

<KeyIdea>
  There is no single "right" approach to sleep. What works best depends on your family's values, your child's temperament, and your own sleep needs. All evidence-based methods respect the baby.
</KeyIdea>

## Feeding & Solids

<div className="quick-only">

- The WHO and most health organizations recommend starting solids **around 6 months**
- Signs of readiness: sitting with minimal support, bringing food to mouth, interest in food, diminished tongue-thrust reflex
- Start with smooth purees or soft foods
- Continue breast milk or formula — solids complement, not replace, milk feeds until 12 months
- **Never force food** — responsive feeding from the start

<TryTonight>
  Offer one new food at a time, 2–3 days apart, to monitor for reactions. Start with vegetables, then fruits, then protein.
</TryTonight>

</div>

<div className="deep-only">

The **WHO, UNICEF, and AAP** all recommend exclusive breastfeeding (or formula) for the first 6 months, followed by complementary foods alongside continued milk feeds.

Starting solids is about **exploration and learning**, not nutrition at first. The majority of calories still come from milk. Babies may spit out food — this is normal, not rejection.

**Responsive feeding** means the parent decides what, when, and where. The child decides whether and how much. Pressure to eat — even gentle pressure — can undermine a child's natural appetite regulation over time.

</div>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">

**Motor:** Rolls, sits with support, bears weight on legs, reaches and transfers objects
**Language:** Babbles consonant sounds (ba, da, ma), laughs, makes sounds to get attention
**Social:** Knows familiar faces, responds to expressions, may show stranger wariness
**Cognitive:** Explores objects with hands and mouth, begins to understand cause and effect

</div>

<div className="deep-only">

The **CDC 6-month milestone checklist** provides a helpful reference, though it's important to remember that these represent **typical ranges, not deadlines**. Premature babies should be evaluated based on corrected age.

Some babies skip crawling entirely and move directly to pulling to stand — this is a normal variation. Motor development follows a general sequence but not a rigid timeline.

</div>

## Play & Stimulation

- **Tummy time:** 30+ minutes total per day (supervised); great for core strength
- **Mirror play:** Babies this age are fascinated by their own reflection
- **Peek-a-boo:** Builds object permanence
- **Narrate everything:** "I'm changing your diaper now. Look at the blue mat!"
- **Simple songs and rhymes:** Rhythm supports language development

## Safety & environment

- Continue **safe sleep** practices: back, firm flat surface, no loose items
- **Baby-proofing becomes urgent** — rolling babies can fall from changing tables
- Car seat: still rear-facing; check weight/height limits
- **Choking hazards:** As solids start, food must be soft and age-appropriate in size
- **No honey** before 12 months (botulism risk)

## When to seek advice

<SeekHelp>

Talk to your pediatrician if by 6 months your baby:
- Does not roll in either direction
- Shows no enjoyment when interacting with people
- Does not make any vowel sounds
- Does not watch things as they move
- Cannot hold their head steady

Use the CDC's free milestone tracker app for a helpful reference.
