## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Tells stories with a beginning, middle, and end
- Counts to 10 and may count higher
- Knows colors and basic shapes
- Real friendships are forming — specific peers matter
- Understands rules in games and may police others following them
- Questions morality and fairness — it's not fair is a constant phrase
- Lies and fantasy may be hard to distinguish
- Can dress and undress independently (mostly)
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Four-year-olds are often described as having big personalities in small bodies. The emotional intensity of the toddler years is beginning to moderate, and in its place you find a child who is genuinely curious, funny, creative, and deeply invested in fairness.

The fairness obsession is developmentally meaningful. Four-year-olds are working out the rules of social interaction — who gets what, how turns work, what is allowed — and they take violations very seriously. This is the beginning of moral reasoning.

<KeyIdea>When your 4-year-old says "that's not fair," resist dismissing it. Even when you cannot change the situation, acknowledging that they feel it is unfair validates their emotional experience and models the empathy you want them to develop.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- No nap for most (some may still occasionally nap)
- Night sleep: 10-12 hours
- Bedtime 7-8pm is typical
- Nightmares common — active imagination has a downside
- Occasional night waking for reassurance
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Most 4-year-olds have dropped their nap, though a quiet rest time is still beneficial for many. Nightmares peak in the preschool years — your child's vivid imagination creates rich dreams, not all of them pleasant.

Respond to nightmares with calm physical presence and reassurance. Avoid dismissing the fear ("it was just a dream") — acknowledge it: "That sounds really scary. You are safe and I am here."

A consistent bedtime routine remains the most effective sleep tool. At 4, your child can understand and participate in the routine rather than just following it.

<TryTonight>If your 4-year-old has nightmares, create a personalized story together where they are the brave hero who overcomes a monster or scary situation. Children who have a narrative about being capable and brave tend to have less nightmare distress.</TryTonight>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Continue family meals without pressure
- Food acceptance may improve as social eating increases
- Continue responsive feeding approach
- Preschool meals may introduce new foods via peer modeling
- No need for separate child menus
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Many parents notice gradual improvement in food acceptance between age 3 and 5. Peer eating is a powerful influence at this age — children eat more variety when they see other children eating it. Preschool lunch tables are actually one of the best environments for food acceptance.

Continue the responsive feeding approach. The Division of Responsibility remains the most evidence-based framework. Your job is what, when, and where; their job is whether and how much.

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 4-year milestones:
- Pretends to be something else during play
- Asks to go to the toilet
- Avoids dangerous things like traffic
- Knows their gender
- Cooperates with other children
- Sings a song or poem from memory
- Tells stories
- Can say their first and last name
- Names some colors and numbers
- Draws a person with 3 or more body parts
- Uses scissors
- Writes some letters
- Buttons some buttons
- Hops on one foot
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Pre-school readiness at 4 is much more about social-emotional skills than academic ones. Can your child separate from you? Play cooperatively? Wait their turn? Follow multi-step instructions? These matter far more for school success than knowing letters.

Pre-literacy skills: knowing that print goes left to right, recognizing their name in print, understanding that words are made of sounds. These develop naturally through reading together.

Screen time guidance: the WHO recommends limiting screen time to 1 hour of quality interactive content per day for 3-4 year olds, and no sedentary screen time. Co-viewing and discussing content with your child makes it more educational.

<TryTonight>Read an interactive book together tonight and ask open questions: "What do you think will happen next?" "Why do you think she did that?" Higher-order questioning during shared book reading is one of the most powerful language and thinking activities available.</TryTonight>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Beginning to understand road safety rules but still needs supervision
- Body safety education appropriate at this age
- Bicycle helmet — consider balance bike to bicycle transition
- Screen time: 1 hour per day maximum, co-viewing recommended
- Playground: supervise but allow age-appropriate risk
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Cannot understand others or be understood by unfamiliar adults
- Limited interest in other children or avoids cooperative play
- Difficulty following simple 2-3 step directions
- Significant fears that prevent normal daily activities
- Loss of any previously acquired skill
