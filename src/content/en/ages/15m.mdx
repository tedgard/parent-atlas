## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Walking well and beginning to climb
- 5-10 words (some toddlers have more, some fewer)
- Points to ask for things and to show you things of interest
- Copies actions you do (sweeping, talking on phone)
- Shows affection — hugs, kisses
- Says no and means it
- Tantrums beginning as independence grows
- Plays independently for short stretches
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Fifteen months is an age of profound contradiction: your toddler desperately wants independence but constantly needs reassurance. They push you away and cling to you in the same hour. This is completely normal and reflects the healthy tension between exploration and security at this developmental stage.

The vocabulary is expanding, but communication is still limited — which is one of the major drivers of frustration and tantrums. Your toddler knows what they want, but cannot yet express it reliably. The gap between understanding and expression is real and frustrating for them.

<KeyIdea>Toddlers who tantrum are not misbehaving. The prefrontal cortex — the part of the brain responsible for emotional regulation — does not mature until the mid-twenties. Tantrums are the brain working exactly as expected at this age.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Most 15-month-olds are on 1 nap (or transitioning)
- Nap: 1-3 hours, usually early afternoon
- Night sleep: 10-12 hours
- Bedtime battles may emerge
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
By 15 months, most toddlers have transitioned to or are close to transitioning to 1 nap per day. The nap transition is often bumpy — expect overtiredness and early bedtime needs during the adjustment period (which can take 4-6 weeks).

Bedtime battles are common at this age. Your toddler has enough awareness to know they are missing out when put to bed, but not enough emotional regulation to manage it calmly.

A consistent, predictable routine is your best tool. The actual activities matter less than the consistency and sequence.

<TryTonight>Choose 3-4 elements for your bedtime routine and do them in the same order every night. The predictability itself is calming for toddlers. A visual routine card (simple drawings) can give your toddler a sense of control.</TryTonight>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Continue family meals with appropriate texture and size
- Whole cow's milk: up to 500ml per day (more replaces iron-rich foods)
- 3 meals + 2 snacks routine helps regulate appetite
- Picky eating is normal — keep offering without pressure
- Let toddler self-feed as much as possible
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Food neophobia (fear of new foods) often peaks in the toddler years. This is evolutionary — in ancestral environments, toddlers who became suspicious of new foods were protected from poisoning as they became more independent.

The research on picky eating is clear: pressure, bribery, and forced eating do not improve acceptance and often make it worse. Repeated neutral exposure — offering the same food across many meals without comment or pressure — is the most evidence-based approach.

<KeyIdea>It can take 15-20 exposures to a new food before a toddler accepts it. Each exposure counts even if they refuse — learning that a food is safe and non-threatening is a step toward acceptance.</KeyIdea>

<TryTonight>Involve your toddler in food preparation in a small way — letting them stir, pour, or wash vegetables. Children are significantly more likely to try foods they have helped prepare.</TryTonight>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 15-month milestones:
- Copies other children while playing
- Shows you an object they like
- Claps when excited
- Hugs stuffed dolls or other toys
- Shows you affection
- Tries to say 1-2 words besides mama or dada
- Looks at a familiar book and points at pictures
- Walks alone
- Uses fingers to point
- Feeds themselves with fingers
- Tries to use a spoon
- Drinks from a cup without a lid
- Stacks at least 2 blocks
- Gets into a sitting position alone
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Language development at 15 months: typically 5-10 words, though the range is wide. If your toddler has fewer words but is communicating effectively through pointing, gestures, and understanding, that context matters.

Imitation is a key cognitive activity at 15 months. Your toddler watches everything you do and tries to replicate it. This is how they learn. Simple household activities — sweeping, wiping, stirring — are learning opportunities.

Books remain the single most powerful language tool available. Point to pictures, name them, and let your toddler turn pages and interact with the book.

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Climbing means new hazards — check furniture stability
- Never leave a toddler near water without direct supervision
- Keep medicines, vitamins, and cleaning products locked away
- Window guards on upper-floor windows
- Car seat: rear-facing still recommended
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Fewer than 3 words by 15 months
- Not walking by 15 months
- Not pointing to things by 15 months
- No imitation of actions or sounds
- Loss of any previously acquired skill — always worth discussing promptly
