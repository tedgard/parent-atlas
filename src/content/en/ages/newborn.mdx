## What you may see

<div className="quick-only">

- Sleeps 14–17 hours a day (in short stretches)
- Communicates through crying, rooting, and facial expressions
- Startles at sounds (Moro reflex)
- Focuses on faces at about 8–12 inches
- Can grasp your finger

</div>

<div className="deep-only">

Newborns come into the world with a set of reflexes that help them survive and connect. The **Moro reflex** (startle response), **rooting reflex** (turning toward touch on the cheek), and **sucking reflex** are all present at birth. These reflexes fade naturally over the first few months.

Newborns can already **recognize their parent's voice** — they've been hearing it for months. Skin-to-skin contact in the first hours supports bonding, temperature regulation, and breastfeeding initiation.

</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">

- Total: 14–17 hours/day
- Cycles are short (40–50 min); waking between cycles is normal
- No day/night awareness yet — develops around 6–8 weeks
- Safe sleep: back position, firm flat surface, no loose bedding

<TryTonight>
  Place baby on their back in a firm, flat, clear sleep space. Room-sharing (not bed-sharing) is recommended for at least the first 6 months.
</TryTonight>

</div>

<div className="deep-only">

Newborns have no circadian rhythm at birth — it develops gradually as light/dark cycles and feeding patterns establish themselves over 6–8 weeks. It's normal for them to sleep more during the day at first.

**Night wakings are biological, not behavioral** at this stage. Newborns have small stomachs and need frequent feeds, typically every 2–3 hours.

<KeyIdea>
  You cannot "spoil" a newborn. Responding consistently to their needs builds the secure attachment that, paradoxically, helps them become more independent later.
</KeyIdea>

The AAP recommends **room-sharing without bed-sharing** for at least 6 months to reduce SIDS risk.

</div>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">

- Breast milk or formula on demand — usually every 2–3 hours (8–12 times/day)
- Hunger cues: rooting, sucking on fists, stirring
- Full cues: turning away, relaxed hands, stopping sucking
- No solids until around 6 months

</div>

<div className="deep-only">

**Responsive feeding** from birth matters. Watch for hunger cues rather than watching the clock: rooting, stirring, bringing hands to mouth. Crying is a late hunger cue.

Breastfed babies may feed more frequently than formula-fed babies because breast milk digests faster. Both are valid choices — what matters is that baby is growing and you're responding to their cues.

<TryTonight>
  Before your baby cries, watch for early hunger cues: rooting, lip smacking, or bringing hands to mouth. Feeding before crying starts often goes more smoothly.
</TryTonight>

## Safety & environment

- **Back to sleep, every sleep** — reduces SIDS risk significantly
- Safe sleep surface: firm, flat, no bumpers, no loose items
- Car seat: rear-facing from birth
- Temperature: 68–72°F (20–22°C) in the room
- Tummy time while **awake and supervised** — important for motor development

## When to seek advice

<SeekHelp>

Talk to your pediatrician if your newborn:
- Has fewer than 6 wet diapers/day after day 4
- Is not back to birth weight by 2 weeks
- Shows yellowing of eyes or skin beyond day 3
- Is difficult to wake for feeds
- Has a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher — **this is urgent in the first 3 months**
