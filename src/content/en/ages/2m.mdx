## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Genuine social smiles in response to your face and voice
- More vocalizations — cooing sounds begin
- Follows moving objects 180 degrees (side to side)
- More predictable awake windows (around 60-90 minutes)
- May briefly study their own hands
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Two months is a delightful turning point. That first real social smile — unmistakably directed at you — is one of the great rewards of early parenthood. Unlike the reflexive smiles of the newborn period, these smiles are social: your baby is responding to your face, your voice, and your presence.

Cooing is the first stage of language development. When your baby coos, respond as if having a conversation — pause, let them coo again, respond. This serve-and-return interaction is one of the most powerful things you can do for language development.

<KeyIdea>The serve-and-return interaction — responding to your baby's sounds and expressions — builds more neural connections than any toy or screen ever could. You are the best developmental tool your baby has.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Total sleep: 12-16 hours per day
- Still irregular, but may begin to show slight patterns
- Wake windows: approximately 60-90 minutes between naps
- Some babies begin a longer first stretch at night (4-6 hours)
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Sleep is beginning to organize very slowly. Melatonin production starts to increase around 6-8 weeks, which is why some families notice a longer nighttime stretch emerging around this age. Do not assume it will last — regressions are common.

Wake windows of around 60-90 minutes are typical. Putting baby down before they are overtired will generally result in better sleep than waiting until they are clearly exhausted.

<TryTonight>Try watching for sleepy cues around 60-75 minutes after your baby last woke. Watch for: glazed eyes, slowing movements, yawning. Begin your settling routine before these signs escalate to crying.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Continue on-demand feeding: typically 8-12 times per 24 hours for breastfed babies
- Formula-fed babies may go 3-4 hours between feeds
- A growth spurt around 6 weeks may increase hunger temporarily
- Breastfed baby weight checks reassure supply is adequate
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
At 2 months, feeding patterns may feel slightly more predictable, though still not scheduled. Breastfed babies continue to need 8-12 feeds per 24 hours. Formula-fed babies may be going 3-4 hours between feeds as their stomach capacity increases.

If you are breastfeeding and worried about supply, the best indicators are your baby's weight gain and wet nappy output — not how much milk you can pump. Many babies feed efficiently from the breast while appearing not to transfer much when pumping.
</div>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 2-month milestones:
- Smiles at people
- Can briefly calm themselves (may bring hand to mouth)
- Tries to look at parent
- Coos and makes gurgling sounds
- Turns head toward sounds
- Pays attention to faces
- Follows things with eyes
- Recognizes people at a distance
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
The 2-month well visit is the first time your pediatrician formally checks developmental milestones. The CDC's updated 2022 milestone list focuses on what most babies can do by 2 months, not the earliest possible achievement.

Tummy time continues to be important. Goal: at least 30 minutes total per day, broken into short sessions throughout the day. Your baby is building the foundation for rolling, sitting, and eventually standing.

<KeyIdea>Tummy time is not optional. It is the foundation of all gross motor development. If your baby hates it, try prone time on your chest, or use a rolled towel under the chest for support.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Vaccinations

<div className="quick-only">
- The 2-month vaccines are typically the first set (varies by country)
- Common vaccines: DTaP, Hib, PCV, rotavirus, polio
- Expect fussiness, low-grade fever, and disrupted sleep for 1-2 days
- Ask your doctor about infant paracetamol/acetaminophen dosing
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
The 2-month vaccines protect against some of the most serious diseases of early childhood. It is normal and expected for babies to be fussier, have a low-grade fever, and sleep differently for 24-48 hours afterward.

Tips for vaccine day:
- Breastfeed or bottle-feed during or immediately after the injections if possible — it reduces pain significantly
- Prepare for a clingy, fussy evening
- Check with your provider about fever management

<TryTonight>On vaccine day, plan for a quiet evening at home. Your baby may need extra holding and feeding. This is normal and temporary.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Continue safe sleep: back, alone, firm flat surface
- Never leave baby unattended on a changing table or elevated surface
- Skin-to-skin and babywearing are safe and beneficial
- Begin reading aloud — any time is a good time to start
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- No social smile by 2 months — this is a formal CDC milestone flag
- Does not respond to loud sounds
- Does not follow things with eyes
- Does not make sounds
- Does not bring hands to mouth
- Cannot hold head up when on tummy
- You have concerns about your own mental health — you deserve support too
