## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Can count objects to 10 (not just recite numbers)
- Writes some letters — especially letters in their name
- Tells simple jokes and enjoys wordplay
- Negotiates with peers and adults
- More aware of rules and fairness
- Managing emotions better (though still imperfect)
- Clear friendships with preferred peers
- More comfortable in brief separations
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Five is a year of consolidation. The dramatic gains of ages 2-4 settle into a more competent, calmer child who is genuinely ready — emotionally and cognitively — for the structures of school.

The friendships of 5-year-olds are real and meaningful. Best friends, falling out, making up — social life is complex and emotionally significant. Support your child in navigating these relationships rather than solving conflicts for them.

<KeyIdea>Social-emotional readiness for school matters as much as — arguably more than — academic readiness. A child who can take turns, manage frustration, ask for help, and separate from parents without prolonged distress will thrive in school regardless of letter knowledge.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- No nap
- Night sleep: 10-12 hours
- Bedtime routine still very helpful
- Nightmares may continue
- Sufficient sleep is strongly associated with learning and emotional regulation
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Adequate sleep at age 5 is genuinely important for school functioning. Sleep deprivation in young children affects attention, emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and behavior — all things that determine how well a school day goes.

Common sleep challenges at 5:
- Prolonged bedtime resistance
- Difficulty settling when sharing a room with a sibling
- Nightmares or night waking

A consistent, calming bedtime routine (30-45 minutes) and a firm but warm lights-out is the most effective approach.

<TryTonight>Use a visual schedule for bedtime: simple drawings of each step (bath, pajamas, brush teeth, books, goodnight). Letting your child check off each step gives them autonomy and reduces negotiation.</TryTonight>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Continue family meals — school lunch is a new feeding context
- Food acceptance often improves in the 5-7 year range
- Keep variety available without pressure
- School lunch boxes: aim for familiar favorites plus one new thing
- Cooking together is a powerful acceptance tool
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Most children show gradual improvement in food variety between ages 5 and 7. The combination of peer eating, increased autonomy, and developmental food curiosity starts to work in parents' favor.

School lunch introduces a new context: no parental pressure, social eating, and often different food choices than home. Many parents are surprised that their picky eater tries things at school they refuse at home. This is peer influence in action.

<TryTonight>Involve your 5-year-old in planning one family dinner this week — let them choose the protein, a vegetable they are willing to try, and a side dish. Children who have input into meal planning eat more variety at that meal.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 5-year milestones:
- Follows rules or takes turns when playing games
- Sings, dances, or acts
- Does simple chores at home
- Uses forks, spoons, and knives
- Is aware of gender
- Can tell what things are made for
- Counts to 10
- Says name and address
- Uses sentences of more than 5 words
- Tells a simple story
- Draws a person with 6 body parts
- Prints some letters or numbers
- Can use the toilet on their own
- Hops, skips, and jumps
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
School readiness at 5 encompasses:
- Cognitive: letters and sounds, counting, colors, shapes
- Language: can express needs and understand instructions
- Social: can play cooperatively, take turns, manage disappointment
- Emotional: can separate from parents, regulate major emotions
- Self-care: toilet independence, dressing, eating independently

Pre-literacy: most 5-year-olds know most letters and are beginning to understand that letters represent sounds. Reading aloud together — pointing to words as you read — is still one of the most powerful activities for literacy development.

Executive function skills — planning, flexible thinking, working memory, impulse control — are more predictive of school success than IQ. These are built through play, routine, and meaningful conversation.

<TryTonight>Play a simple card game like Memory or Snap with your 5-year-old tonight. Card games build working memory, turn-taking, and the ability to manage winning and losing — all critical school readiness skills.</TryTonight>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Road safety: 5-year-olds can learn the concept but still need adult supervision
- Online safety begins: if using devices, use parental controls and co-view
- Body safety: review consent and private parts conversations annually
- Stranger danger: updated concept — trusted adult network is more useful
- Bicycle: graduated exposure with helmet always
</div>

## When to Seek Advice
