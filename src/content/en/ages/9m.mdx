## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Crawls or scoots (some babies skip crawling entirely)
- Pulls to stand on furniture
- Pincer grasp developing (uses thumb and index finger)
- Says mama and dada but not specifically to the right parent yet
- Waves bye-bye and plays peek-a-boo
- Strong stranger anxiety and separation anxiety — clingy and upset when parent leaves
- Understands simple words like no and their own name
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Nine months is an explosion of purposeful motor action. Your baby is now getting themselves where they want to go, pulling to stand on anything they can grip, and exploring the world with increasing intentionality.

Stranger and separation anxiety peak around 9-12 months and are entirely normal — in fact, they signal healthy attachment. When your baby cries as you leave the room, that is evidence that they have formed a deep, secure bond with you.

<KeyIdea>Stranger anxiety is not regression or bad behavior. It is a cognitive milestone — your baby now understands that people and objects are permanent, and that losing sight of you matters. Always say goodbye; sneaking away makes anxiety worse over time.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Typically on 2 naps (morning and afternoon)
- Night sleep more consolidated: 10-12 hours
- Separation anxiety may trigger new or increased night wakings
- Total sleep: 12-15 hours per day
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Most 9-month-olds are on two naps — a morning nap (often shorter) and an afternoon nap. Consolidated night sleep of 10-12 hours is common, though not universal.

The arrival of separation anxiety often disrupts sleep that had previously been settled. Your baby may begin waking at night and crying with genuine distress. Responding to this is not spoiling them — it is appropriate parenting. How you respond (with reassurance rather than long feeding sessions if you are trying to limit night feeds) can help.

<TryTonight>If separation anxiety is causing night wakings, try a brief, predictable response: go in, reassure with voice and a hand on the back, leave before baby is asleep. Repeat consistently. Predictability reduces anxiety over time.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Breast milk or formula remains the primary nutrition source
- Finger foods in earnest: soft, small pieces (1cm cubes)
- Responsive feeding: offer food, let baby decide how much
- 3 meals per day with some texture and variety
- Do not add salt or sugar to baby food
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
At 9 months, solid foods are becoming a meaningful part of the diet — but breast milk or formula is still the primary source of nutrition for most babies. Aim for 3 small meals of soft finger foods daily, alongside continued milk feeds.

The responsive feeding approach means: you decide what to offer and when; your baby decides whether to eat and how much. This division of responsibility is supported by the WHO, AAP, and most major nutrition bodies as the approach most protective against feeding difficulties later.

<KeyIdea>Never force, coax, or distract babies into eating more than they want. Overriding internal hunger and satiety cues in infancy is associated with feeding difficulties and disordered eating patterns later. Trust your baby's signals.</KeyIdea>

Finger food ideas:
- Soft-cooked vegetable pieces (broccoli, carrot, sweet potato)
- Small pieces of ripe banana, pear, or melon
- Soft-cooked pasta pieces
- Small cubes of soft cheese
- Scrambled egg

<TryTonight>Offer one new food alongside one familiar food at dinner tonight. If baby rejects the new food, that is fine — put it on the tray without comment and let them explore at their own pace. Repeated neutral exposure is the key to food acceptance.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 9-month milestones:
- Is shy, clingy, or fearful around strangers
- Shows several facial expressions
- Looks when you call their name
- Reacts when you leave
- Smiles or laughs when you play peek-a-boo or pat-a-cake
- Makes a lot of different sounds
- Lifts arms up to be picked up
- Picks things up between thumb and index finger
- Moves things from one hand to the other
- Uses fingers to rake food toward self
- Sits without support
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Language development is primarily receptive at 9 months — your baby understands far more than they can say. They may understand mama, dada, bye-bye, no, and their own name.

Joint attention is emerging: your baby will look at what you are pointing at, and may start to point themselves. This is a crucial prelinguistic skill.

Reading aloud remains one of the highest-impact activities you can do. Point to pictures, name them simply, and let your baby turn pages.
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Baby is now mobile — childproofing is urgent
- Stair gates at top and bottom of all stairs
- Cabinet locks for cleaning products, medicines, and sharp items
- No small objects within reach (choking hazard)
- No button batteries, coins, or small magnets accessible
- Anchor heavy furniture to the wall
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
A crawling baby can reach a choking hazard, a staircase, or an unsecured piece of furniture in seconds. Do a floor-level crawl through your home and remove or secure anything hazardous.

Water safety: never leave a mobile baby near any standing water — even a few centimeters in a bucket is a drowning risk.
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Not babbling (no consonant sounds like ba, da, ma) by 9 months
- Not bearing weight on legs when supported
- Not sitting with support
- Shows no interest in two-way interaction or social play
- Does not respond to their own name
- Does not look when you point to something
