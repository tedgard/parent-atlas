## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Rolls from tummy to back (usually before back to tummy)
- Laughs and giggles — real, full belly laughs
- Holds head completely steady when held upright
- Brings hands together in the midline
- Reaches and grasps objects intentionally
- Double vision has resolved — truly tracks moving objects smoothly
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Four months is a genuinely exciting age. Real laughs, intentional grasps, and social engagement that feels truly reciprocal. Your baby is becoming a small person with opinions and preferences.

Rolling from tummy to back is often the first roll, driven by the head-heavy physics of a baby learning to push up. Back-to-tummy rolling usually comes a few weeks to months later.

<KeyIdea>At 4 months, binocular vision matures — both eyes now work together properly. This is why your baby suddenly seems to track objects with much greater precision and interest.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- The 4-month sleep regression is a permanent change in sleep architecture
- More night wakings and shorter naps are common and normal
- This is developmental, not a problem to fix immediately
- Sleep associations (what baby needs to fall asleep) become very important now
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
The 4-month sleep regression is not a phase that passes — it is a permanent developmental change. Before 4 months, babies cycle through fewer, lighter stages of sleep. After 4 months, sleep architecture permanently reorganizes to resemble adult sleep cycles, with more frequent light-sleep transitions.

This means that whatever your baby needed to fall asleep at bedtime, they now also need each time they surface during a sleep cycle — typically every 45-60 minutes at first.

If your baby was falling asleep on the breast or bottle, they will likely wake and need the same input to fall back asleep. This is a sleep association, not a bad habit.

<KeyIdea>The 4-month sleep regression is not caused by sleep training or parenting choices. It is a biological maturation of the sleep system. The regression itself cannot be prevented — but how you respond shapes the next months of sleep.</KeyIdea>

What helps now:
- Begin a consistent, predictable bedtime routine
- Try putting baby down drowsy but not fully asleep occasionally
- Wake windows: approximately 2 hours
- 3-4 naps per day

<TryTonight>Try laying your baby down just before they fall fully asleep tonight. If they fuss, that is okay — practice this once per day. You are beginning to teach them a skill they will use for the rest of their life.</TryTonight>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Continue breastfeeding or formula on demand
- Breastfeeding during the regression may feel like supply is dropping — it usually is not
- No solid foods yet — wait until 6 months (or 4-6 months per pediatrician guidance)
- Increased feeding frequency during regression is normal
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
The 4-month sleep regression and apparent milk supply concerns often arrive together. When babies wake more frequently at night, they often feed more at night and slightly less efficiently during the day.

Breastfeeding parents often experience this as feeling that their breasts feel softer, that supply feels lower. In most cases, supply is fine — milk production has simply regulated to match demand, and the supply-demand rhythm has temporarily shifted.

Continue feeding on demand. If weight gain is adequate and wet nappies are normal, supply is almost certainly sufficient.

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 4-month milestones:
- Holds head steady without support
- Holds a toy when you put it in their hand
- Uses both hands to hold objects
- Puts things in mouth
- Pushes down on legs when feet are on a hard surface
- Rolls from tummy to back
- Coos when you talk to them
- Laughs
- Makes sounds to show joy
- Looks at your face
- Follows moving things with eyes from side to side
- Recognizes familiar people
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Tummy time is more productive and more tolerated now. Aim for 30+ minutes per day in total. Your baby should be able to push up onto forearms and briefly onto hands.

Language development: your baby is now a vocal conversationalist. They coo, babble, and vary pitch and volume expressively. Narrate your day, read aloud, and respond to their sounds.

<TryTonight>Get on the floor at your baby's level during tummy time and hold a mirror in front of them. Many 4-month-olds are fascinated by their reflection. This supports social development and makes tummy time tolerable.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Rolling means never leave baby unattended on any raised surface
- Continue back-to-sleep; if baby rolls onto tummy during sleep, leave them
- Tummy time goal: 30+ minutes per day supervised
- No walkers or jumpers that put weight on spine before baby can sit independently
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>

- Does not smile at people
- Shows no interest in people or interaction
- Does not bring things to their mouth
- Does not push down on legs when feet touch a hard surface
- Does not make sounds
- Does not turn toward sounds
- Loses skills they previously had
