## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Multi-sentence conversations on topics of their choosing
- The why phase in full swing — questions about everything
- Imaginative play with storylines and characters
- Plays with other children, not just alongside them (cooperative play)
- Can partially dress themselves
- Understands and mostly follows simple rules
- Magical thinking: believes in Santa, fairies, monsters
- Beginning to understand the difference between real and pretend
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Three is a remarkable age. Your child is now a genuine conversational partner — they have opinions, memories, and a rich inner life that they are beginning to share with you. The questions are relentless, and that is exactly as it should be.

The why phase reflects the emergence of causal reasoning — a foundational cognitive skill. When your 3-year-old asks why the sky is blue, they are not just making conversation. They are building the mental frameworks that will underlie scientific and logical thinking for decades.

<KeyIdea>Answering why questions honestly — including saying "I don't know, let's find out" — builds intellectual curiosity and models the scientific mindset. You do not need to know all the answers. The act of wondering together is the lesson.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Nap may be dropping or already gone for some children
- Quiet time replaces nap when dropped
- Bedtime: 7-8pm works for most
- Total sleep: 10-13 hours
- Consistent bedtime routine is essential at this age
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
By age 3, some children have dropped their nap; many still need it. The nap transition ranges from 2 to 4 years. If your child has dropped the nap, an earlier bedtime (6:30-7pm) helps prevent overtiredness.

A consistent bedtime routine is more important, not less, as children get older and more capable of negotiation. The routine provides a frame your child knows and can anticipate, which reduces resistance.

Three-year-olds may develop elaborate bedtime rituals (the exact arrangement of stuffed animals, the specific blanket) that feel very important to them. These rituals are reassuring and should generally be accommodated — within reason.

<TryTonight>Give your 3-year-old some controlled choices within the bedtime routine: which of these two books shall we read? Which pajamas? Small choices within a framework give children a sense of control that reduces bedtime power struggles.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Food neophobia is common and normal in preschoolers
- Keep mealtimes relaxed — no pressure, no power struggles
- Division of responsibility: parent offers, child decides
- Family meals: eat together whenever possible
- Preschoolers are highly influenced by what they see peers eating
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Food neophobia (resistance to new foods) is particularly common in preschool years. Studies show it is partly genetic and partly environmental — and that the most protective factor is repeated exposure in a low-pressure environment.

The Division of Responsibility (Ellyn Satter's model):
- Parent's job: decide what foods are offered, when meals happen, and where
- Child's job: decide whether to eat the offered food and how much
Following this division consistently is associated with better long-term eating patterns and lower rates of eating disorders.

<KeyIdea>Children who are pressured to eat more vegetables tend to eat fewer vegetables as adults. The pressure itself creates a negative association. Trust your child's appetite and keep offering without reaction.</KeyIdea>

<TryTonight>Eat one food that your child currently refuses, visibly enjoying it, without comment or invitation. Peer and adult modeling is a powerful and underused tool for food acceptance.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 3-year milestones:
- Calms down within 10 minutes after you leave
- Notices other children and joins them to play
- Talks with you in conversation using at least 2 back-and-forth exchanges
- Asks who, what, where, or why questions
- Says first name when asked
- Talks well enough for others to understand most of the time
- Draws a circle when shown how
- Uses forks and spoons
- Can put on some clothes
- Climbs, runs, and jumps
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Pre-literacy skills are the priority at 3 years — not formal reading instruction. Books, rhymes, songs, and environmental print (pointing to letters on cereal boxes, signs) build phonological awareness and print concepts organically.

Emotional development: your 3-year-old is beginning to understand that other people have feelings different from their own. This is the beginning of empathy. Naming emotions in books, in others, and in themselves is the best way to build emotional vocabulary.

Fine motor skills: drawing, cutting with safety scissors, and manipulating small objects are all important preparations for writing.
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Road safety is a major priority: hold hands, stop at curbs
- Can ride a balance bike or tricycle — helmet always
- Water safety: swimming lessons beneficial but not drowning-proof
- Screen time: WHO recommends no more than 1 hour of quality interactive content per day
- Stranger safety: begin simple body safety conversations
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Strangers cannot understand your child's speech most of the time
- Not interested in other children or cooperative play
- Does not use sentences of 3+ words
- Cannot follow 2-step instructions
- Loss of any previously acquired skill
- Extreme tantrums that are getting worse rather than better
