## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Walking (may not be yet — normal range is 9-15 months)
- 1-2 words with real meaning (mama, dada used specifically)
- Waves, claps hands
- Follows simple one-step instructions (come here, give me)
- Points to share interest in something (not just to request)
- Cruises along furniture confidently
- Strong preferences and opinions — becomes upset when thwarted
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
The first birthday is a significant milestone more for parents than for babies, but it does mark a genuine shift: your baby is becoming a toddler. The word toddler comes from toddling — that endearing uncertain walk that is just beginning.

If your baby is not yet walking at 12 months, do not panic. The WHO defines the normal walking range as 8.5-20 months, and most major pediatric bodies do not flag concern until 18 months. Genetics plays a significant role.

<KeyIdea>Pointing to share — not just to ask — is one of the most important developmental indicators at 12 months. A baby who points at a dog to show you, looks at you to check your reaction, and then looks back at the dog is demonstrating joint attention, a foundational social-communication skill.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Total sleep: 11-14 hours per day
- Usually 1-2 naps (transition to 1 nap often begins 12-18 months)
- Night sleep: 10-12 hours
- Separation anxiety can continue to affect night sleep
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Most 12-month-olds are on 2 naps, but some are beginning to show readiness to transition to 1 nap. Signs of 1-nap readiness: consistently resisting the morning nap, taking a long time to fall asleep at naptime, early wake after morning nap.

The 1-nap transition is often bumpy. Many families do a gradual shift by slowly pushing the morning nap later until it merges with the afternoon nap, landing around 12-1pm.

<TryTonight>If your toddler is resisting sleep, make sure their bedtime routine is genuinely winding down: dim lights 30-45 minutes before bed, no active play, a bath if it soothes (some children it stimulates), and consistent sequence of events.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Can now eat most family foods (cut appropriately)
- Whole cow's milk can replace formula (not for breastfed babies — continue as long as desired)
- 3 meals + 2-3 snacks per day
- Self-feeding strongly encouraged — messy is good
- No honey until after 1 year
- No unpasteurized dairy, no whole nuts, no foods that are choking risks
- No added salt or sugar
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
At 12 months, the dietary world opens up significantly. Your baby can now share most of what the family eats, cut into appropriate sizes.

Cow's milk introduction: at 12 months, whole (full-fat) cow's milk can replace formula as the main milk drink. Breastfeeding can and should continue for as long as both parent and baby wish.

Picky eating often emerges around this age. This is normal developmental food neophobia. The evidence-based response: keep offering, never pressure, stay positive at mealtimes.

<KeyIdea>The Division of Responsibility (Ellyn Satter): the parent's job is to decide what, when, and where food is offered. The child's job is to decide whether to eat and how much. Following this framework is associated with better long-term eating outcomes than pressuring or restricting.</KeyIdea>

Choking hazards to avoid:
- Whole grapes, cherry tomatoes (cut into quarters lengthwise)
- Whole nuts
- Large chunks of raw vegetable or apple
- Popcorn
- Hard round sweets

<TryTonight>Let your toddler feed themselves tonight — even if it means most of the food ends up on the floor or face. Self-feeding builds fine motor skills, appetite awareness, and positive mealtime associations. The mess is worth it.</TryTonight>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 1-year milestones:
- Waves bye-bye
- Calls a parent mama or dada specifically
- Understands the word no
- Pulls up to stand
- Walks holding on to furniture
- Drinks from a cup without a lid (with help)
- Picks up small objects between thumb and forefinger
- Looks for things they see you hide
- Bangs two things together
- Puts things in a container
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Language development at 12 months: most babies have 1-3 meaningful words. But comprehension is far ahead of production — your baby understands dozens of words and simple instructions.

The best thing you can do for language: talk constantly. Narrate your day. Use real words, not just baby talk. Read picture books and name what you see. Limit screens.

Play at 12 months is primarily exploratory and sensorimotor — putting things in and out of containers, banging objects together, dropping and retrieving things. This is genuinely sophisticated cognitive work.

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- A cruising or walking toddler reaches new heights — check shelves and tables
- Keep the toilet lid down and bathroom door closed
- Hot liquid safety — do not hold hot drinks while holding your toddler
- Car seat: rear-facing as long as possible per seat limits
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- No words by 12 months (mama or dada not yet specific)
- Not pointing at things by 12 months
- No waving or other gestures
- Not following simple instructions
- Loss of any previously acquired skill — always worth discussing promptly
- Not walking by 18 months (flag at the 12-month check if concerned)
