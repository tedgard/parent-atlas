## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Sentences of 3-4 words (I want more milk)
- Asks lots of questions — why is a favorite
- Recognizes own name in print
- Plays with other children more cooperatively
- Strong sense of self — my way or tears
- Fears may emerge (dark, monsters, dogs)
- Toilet training may be underway
- Counting objects to 5-10
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
At 2.5, your child is in a rapid transition from toddler to preschooler. Language is becoming genuinely complex — sentences, stories, and questions that require real answers. The why phase is developmentally meaningful: your child is building causal reasoning, the same cognitive foundation that underlies science and critical thinking.

Fears are common and new at this age. The same imagination that makes play so rich also creates monsters under the bed. Fears are real to your child even when they are not real to you. Dismissing them makes them worse; acknowledging and gently exploring them helps.

<KeyIdea>When your child expresses fear, resist the urge to say "there is nothing to be afraid of." Instead try: "You feel scared. Tell me about it." Validating the emotional experience — not the factual content of the fear — is what helps.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Many still on a nap, but nap resistance increases
- Nap drop typically occurs between age 2-4
- Night sleep: 10-12 hours
- Bedtime stalling strategies become sophisticated
- Nightmares begin at this age — reassurance is the response
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
At 2.5, children may appear to no longer need a nap. Many parents find that quiet time (45-60 minutes in the room with books or quiet toys) preserves some cognitive recovery even without sleep.

Bedtime stalling becomes an art form at this age: one more hug, I need water, I'm scared, the blanket is wrong. A consistent routine with a clear endpoint helps: "After we read two books and you have your water, I will say goodnight and close the door."

Nightmares are common from 2.5 onwards. Respond with calm, physical presence and reassurance. Leaving a small nightlight can help reduce the fear of darkness.

<TryTonight>Create a "monster spray" together if your child has fears: a spray bottle with water and a drop of lavender essential oil. The ritual of spraying the room gives your child a sense of agency over their fear, which is more powerful than reassurance alone.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Picky eating may improve slightly or hold steady
- Continue offering variety without pressure
- Involve your child in grocery shopping and meal prep
- Family meals remain the gold standard
- Dessert policy: offer it at the same time as the rest of the meal, not as a reward
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Some children show gradual improvement in food acceptance between 2.5 and 3.5 as language allows them to understand and express preferences more clearly.

The dessert-as-reward model (you have to eat your vegetables to get dessert) is not recommended by pediatric nutrition experts. It increases the perceived value of the dessert, decreases the perceived value of the vegetables, and adds stress to mealtimes. Offering dessert alongside or after the meal without conditions is the approach most supported by evidence.

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
Expected at 2.5 years:
- 3-4 word sentences
- Can name basic colors
- Plays pretend with dolls or animals
- Turns pages one at a time
- Builds a tower of 6+ blocks
- Holds crayons properly (not fist grip)
- Can wash and dry hands
- Toilet training readiness or underway
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Toilet training readiness signs: aware of being wet or dirty, interested in the toilet, can stay dry for 2 hours, can follow simple instructions, can undress at least partially. Most children are ready between 2 and 3.5 years.

The most evidence-based approach: child-led, low-pressure toilet training is faster and has fewer regressions than intensive parent-directed approaches. Follow your child's cues and avoid making toilet training a conflict.

Pre-literacy skills are developing: books, rhymes, singing, and pointing to letters in the environment all contribute to later reading readiness without formal instruction.

<TryTonight>Play a simple rhyming game at dinner: "I spy something that rhymes with... cat." Phonological awareness — the ability to hear the sounds in words — is the single strongest predictor of reading success, and games like this build it effortlessly.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Increasingly independent — can go further and faster
- Parking lot safety: practice stopping and holding hands
- Kitchen safety: rules about hot surfaces and knives
- Water safety: swimming lessons may begin (though drowning prevention is not guaranteed by lessons alone)
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Speech is not understood by familiar adults most of the time
- Not using 3-word phrases
- Loses skills they previously had
- Extreme fears that significantly disrupt daily life
- Limited interest in other children or social play
- No pretend play
