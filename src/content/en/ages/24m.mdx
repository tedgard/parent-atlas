## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- 50+ words and beginning to use 2-word phrases (more milk, daddy go)
- Parallel play is common; beginning to play with others occasionally
- Imaginative play begins in earnest (making food in a toy kitchen)
- Runs, kicks a ball, climbs confidently
- Very curious — explores everything
- Strong sense of mine — sharing is a work in progress
- Tantrums at or near their peak
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Two years old is a landmark moment. The language explosion that often happens between 18 and 24 months means your child suddenly has words for the world — and opinions about all of it.

Tantrums peak around 18 months to 3 years. The combination of increasingly complex desires, still-limited language, and no capacity for emotional regulation creates the perfect storm. This is normal. You are not doing it wrong.

<KeyIdea>The most effective tantrum response is not ignoring, not reasoning, and not giving in — it is empathic acknowledgment followed by calm holding of the limit. Name the feeling, validate the desire, hold the boundary: "You want to keep playing. I know that is so hard. We are leaving now."</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Still on 1 nap, though may begin to resist
- Nap dropped between age 2-4 for most children
- Total sleep: 11-14 hours per day
- Quiet time can replace nap when dropped
- Consistent bedtime routine is essential
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Some 2-year-olds begin resisting their nap. This does not mean the nap is ready to be dropped — most children still genuinely need daytime sleep at 2. Nap resistance is often about control rather than genuine lack of sleepiness.

Try keeping the nap structure even when your child resists: a quiet time in their room with books for 45-60 minutes serves cognitive recovery even when sleep does not come.

If nap is genuinely dropped, move bedtime earlier (6:30-7pm) to compensate for lost daytime sleep.

<TryTonight>If bedtime has become a battle, try adding a "special" book that only gets read at bedtime. The anticipated reward can make the transition to bed more appealing — and it gives your toddler a sense of control over one element of the routine.</TryTonight>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Picky eating peaks — keep offering without pressure
- Repeated neutral exposure works; forced eating does not
- Involve your toddler in simple meal preparation
- Family meals: eat together, eat the same thing
- Avoid making mealtimes a battleground
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Picky eating is at or near its peak at 2 years. This is developmentally normal. The worst thing you can do is make mealtimes stressful — research shows that mealtime stress is independently associated with worse eating outcomes, regardless of what is served.

What helps:
- Eat together as a family whenever possible
- Serve one food you know they like alongside new or refused foods
- Do not comment on what or how much they eat
- Keep portions small — a tablespoon per year of age is a reasonable serving
- Repeated exposure without reaction is the key

<KeyIdea>Involving children in food preparation from a young age is one of the most powerful levers for food acceptance. Even simple tasks — washing vegetables, pouring ingredients, stirring — increase willingness to try the resulting food.</KeyIdea>

<TryTonight>Try a deconstructed dinner: put the components of a meal in separate small bowls on the table and let your toddler combine or not combine them as they choose. Children are more likely to try foods when they control the plate composition.</TryTonight>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 2-year milestones:
- Notices other children and joins them to play
- Shows you what they can do — look at me
- Follows 2-step instructions
- Uses 2-word phrases
- Points to things in a book
- Uses more gestures like blowing a kiss or nodding yes
- Holds something in one hand while using the other
- Tries to use a fork and spoon
- Runs
- Walks up a few stairs with support
- Jumps off the ground with both feet
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Language is the big developmental story at 2 years. Two-word phrases (more milk, daddy go, big dog) are expected. Some children are significantly ahead of this; some are slightly behind. The key is trajectory — moving in the right direction.

Potty training readiness signs may begin to emerge: showing awareness of being wet or dirty, interest in the toilet, ability to follow simple instructions. Most children are ready between 2 and 3.5 years.

Emotional coaching — naming emotions, validating feelings, helping problem-solve — is the most evidence-based approach to emotional development at this age. Start simple: "You look sad. Is it because your tower fell?"
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Can now open doors — door handles and latches may need child guards
- Climbing to reach high things — anchor all tall furniture
- Road safety: hold hands near traffic always
- Playground safety: supervise climbing equipment
- Screen time: limit to 1 hour per day of high-quality content for 2-5 year olds (WHO)
</div>

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Fewer than 50 words by 24 months
