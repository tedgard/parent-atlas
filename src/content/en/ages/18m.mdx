## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Walks well, may begin to run (with a characteristic toddler wobble)
- 10-25 words (wide normal range)
- Points to ask for things, to share interest, and to show needs
- Shows affection spontaneously — hugs, kisses, bringing you things
- Plays alongside other children (parallel play)
- Begins to assert independence — testing boundaries is normal
- Tantrums are common and developmentally appropriate
- Pretend play beginnings (talks to a toy phone)
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Eighteen months is often called the age of toddler awakening — your child is simultaneously more capable, more aware, and more frustrated than they have ever been. The gap between what they want to do and what they can communicate is at its widest.

Tantrums are a signal of healthy development, not bad parenting. The toddler brain is wired to feel emotions intensely but has almost no capacity to regulate them. Your role is not to prevent tantrums but to help your toddler through them safely.

<KeyIdea>Emotional regulation is not a character trait — it is a skill that is taught, modeled, and practiced over years. You are not raising a child who does not have tantrums. You are raising a child who will eventually manage emotions. That takes until age 6-7 at the earliest.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Most on 1 nap per day
- Total sleep: 11-14 hours
- Nap: 1-2 hours in early afternoon
- Bedtime battles common
- Some toddlers begin climbing out of cribs — may need transition to toddler bed
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
By 18 months, the vast majority of toddlers are on 1 nap per day. The 1-nap schedule typically places the nap around 12-1pm, with bedtime around 7-8pm.

Bedtime resistance is almost universal at this age. Toddlers understand enough to know they prefer to be with you, but lack the regulation to accept bedtime gracefully. A brief, consistent routine (15-30 minutes) followed by a firm but warm goodnight is more effective than prolonged negotiations.

<TryTonight>Try the one-warning method: 5 minutes before bedtime, warn your toddler that bedtime is coming. Use simple, predictable language: "After this book, it is sleep time." Reducing the surprise of transitions reduces resistance.</TryTonight>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Picky eating is normal and common — do not panic
- Food jags (only wanting the same food) are typical
- 3 meals + 2 snacks routine provides structure
- Pressure backfires — responsive feeding is the evidence-based approach
- Continue family meals; toddlers eat what they see others eating
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Toddler picky eating peaks between 18 months and 3 years. Food jags — periods where your toddler only wants one or two specific foods — are normal and temporary. Offering variety alongside accepted foods is the recommended approach.

The research on what actually works:
- Repeated exposure without pressure (it can take 15-20 exposures)
- Family meals where everyone eats the same food
- Toddler involvement in simple food preparation
- Division of responsibility: parent decides what, when, where; child decides whether and how much

What does not work and often makes things worse:
- Bribing with dessert
- Forcing or pressuring
- Short-order cooking different meals

<TryTonight>Serve dinner family style tonight with all dishes in the center of the table. Let your toddler serve themselves from the dishes (with help). Children consistently eat better when they have some agency in what lands on their plate.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
CDC 18-month milestones:
- Moves and dances to music
- Scribbles with a crayon
- Refers to self
- Tries to say 3 or more words besides mama or dada
- Follows 1-step instructions without gestures
- Plays with toys in a simple way (pushing a toy car)
- Looks at a few pages in a book with you
- Points to show you something interesting
- Walks without holding on
- Drinks from a cup without a lid
- Feeds themselves with fingers
- Tries to use a spoon
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Language development at 18 months is entering a sensitive period. Children with 6+ words at 18 months and who point reliably are typically developing typically regardless of precise word count.

Pretend play — feeding a stuffed animal, talking into a toy phone — is a sign of sophisticated cognitive development and an important predictor of later language and social skills. Encourage and join in.

Simple commands: your toddler can now follow 1-step instructions without a gestural cue (come here, sit down, get your shoes). This is a useful way to build cooperation while also tracking language comprehension.
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Running, climbing, and falling — expect bumps and bruises
- Screen time: WHO recommends no screen time under 2 years (with the exception of video calls)
- Stair safety remains critical
- Water safety: never alone near any body of water
- Toddler bed transition: only if climbing out of crib, otherwise keep in crib longer
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Fewer than 6 words by 18 months
- Not walking independently
- Not pointing to things by 18 months
- No pretend play
- Does not follow simple instructions
- Loss of any previously acquired skill — always worth discussing promptly
