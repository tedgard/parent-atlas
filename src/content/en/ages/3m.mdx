## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- Big, frequent social smiles — your baby lights up when they see you
- More sustained eye contact and back-and-forth cooing conversations
- Head control improving significantly — less bobbling, more steadiness
- Pushes up on forearms during tummy time
- Reaches for and bats at objects
- Laughing or chuckling may begin at the end of this month
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Three months often feels like a corner has been turned. Your baby is more interactive, more predictable, and more fun. The relentlessness of the newborn period gives way to genuine two-way communication.

Head control is now strong enough that you will notice far less head bobbing when you hold your baby upright. Tummy time sessions are more successful because your baby can actually push up and look around.

<KeyIdea>Three months is often when parents start to feel genuinely competent and connected. If you are still feeling overwhelmed, disconnected, or very low — this is worth discussing with your doctor. You have not missed a window.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Total sleep: 14-16 hours per day
- May begin to show morning and afternoon nap patterns
- First longer night stretch (5-6 hours) may emerge for some babies
- Still not developmentally appropriate to sleep train
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Sleep at 3 months is beginning to organize, though it is still far from predictable. Some babies start to show a longer first night stretch — 5-6 hours for some. This is a biological gift, not something you taught them.

Wake windows are typically 90 minutes to 2 hours at this age. Three to four naps per day is typical.

A bedtime routine is worth establishing now even if sleep itself is variable. Bath, feed, song, dark room — the consistency is what matters, not the length.

<TryTonight>Start a simple 3-step bedtime routine tonight: dim the lights, offer a feed, then a short song or gentle rocking in a dark room. Consistency now builds a sleep association that pays off for months.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Breastfeeding: 7-9 times per 24 hours as feeding becomes more efficient
- Formula: every 3-4 hours, around 120-150 ml per feed
- Distractible feeding begins — babies may pull off the breast frequently
- No solids — still too early (4-6 months is the window)
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Feeding becomes more efficient at 3 months. Breastfed babies may go 3-4 hours between feeds during the day as they become faster and more effective at transferring milk.

Distractible feeding is a hallmark of this age. Your baby may pull off the breast at every sound, look around, then come back. Feeding in a quieter, dimmer room can help.

It is common for breastfeeding parents to worry that supply is dropping when feeds shorten. In most cases, the baby is simply feeding more efficiently.

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
- Holds head steady when held upright
- Pushes up on forearms in tummy time
- Opens and closes hands, brings hands together
- Reaches toward dangling objects
- Smiles spontaneously, especially at people
- Follows moving things with eyes (full 180 degrees)
- Recognizes familiar people at a distance
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Three months is a period of rapid skill consolidation. The baby who could barely lift their head at 1 month is now pushing up on forearms and looking around during tummy time.

Hand awareness is a major theme this month. Your baby has discovered their hands and may spend long periods staring at them, bringing them together, and sucking on them. This is not a sign of hunger — it is a developmental activity.

<TryTonight>Hang a simple high-contrast mobile or toy just within your baby's reach during awake time. Observe how they reach, bat, and study it. Narrate what you see — language learning starts now.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Safe sleep rules remain the same: back, alone, firm surface
- Your baby may begin rolling — always strap on changing table
- Tummy time goal: 30+ minutes total per day
- Avoid devices and screens — baby learns from you, not a screen
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Does not smile at people by 3 months
- Does not follow moving things with eyes
- Does not respond to loud sounds
- Does not notice their own hands
- Head not holding steady at 3-4 months
- You notice one eye turning in or out
- You are still struggling emotionally — postpartum depression can appear or persist into month 3 and beyond
