## What You May See

<div className="quick-only">
- First social smiles are just around the corner (typically between 6-8 weeks)
- More alert, awake periods compared to the newborn days
- Briefly tracks your face when you move slowly in front of them
- Startles at sounds and quiets when they hear your voice
- Crying is still the primary communication tool
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
At one month, your baby is waking up to the world. The first weeks were dominated by sleep and feeding; now you may notice genuine windows of alertness where your baby seems to actually look at you. The visual system is still developing — they see best at 8-12 inches, which is almost exactly the distance between your face and theirs during a feed.

Social smiles (smiles in response to your face or voice, not just gas!) typically emerge between 6 and 8 weeks. If you have not seen one yet at 1 month, that is completely normal. Keep talking, singing, and making eye contact — you are building the foundation.

<KeyIdea>Your baby cannot be spoiled at this age. Responding promptly to cries builds secure attachment and actually leads to less crying over time.</KeyIdea>
</div>

## Sleep

<div className="quick-only">
- Total sleep: 14-17 hours per day across many short periods
- No schedule yet — that is normal
- Slightly longer night stretches may begin (3-4 hours is a meaningful step)
- Day/night confusion may still be present
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Sleep at one month is still largely governed by hunger. Your baby wakes when they need to eat, sleeps when full, and has very little circadian rhythm development yet. The biological clock does not start to mature until around 6-8 weeks.

What helps:
- Expose your baby to natural light during the day
- Keep nighttime feeds calm, quiet, and dim
- Learn your baby's sleepy cues (eye rubs, yawning, staring into space) and settle them before overtired

<TryTonight>During tonight's nighttime feed, keep lights very dim, avoid playful talking, and skip the nappy change if it is not soaked. You are signaling to their developing brain: nighttime is for sleeping, not playing.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Feeding

<div className="quick-only">
- Breastfeed or formula feed on demand: typically 8-10 times per 24 hours
- Each breastfeed may last 10-45 minutes
- Growth spurts often hit around 3 weeks and again around 6 weeks
- Signs of enough intake: 6+ wet nappies per day, steady weight gain
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Responsive feeding means offering the breast or bottle whenever your baby shows hunger cues — rooting, sucking hands, turning head, fussing — rather than watching the clock. At 1 month this usually means 8-10 feeds per 24 hours.

Growth spurts at 3 and 6 weeks are real and intense. Your baby may feed constantly for 1-3 days, which can feel like supply is failing. It is not — cluster feeding is what signals the body to increase milk production.

<KeyIdea>For breastfeeding parents: supply works on demand. The more milk is removed, the more is made. Supplementing with formula during a growth spurt without also pumping can inadvertently reduce supply.</KeyIdea>

Signs feeding is going well:
- 6 or more wet nappies per day after day 4-5
- At least 2-3 dirty nappies per day in the first month
- Baby seems satisfied after most feeds
- Weight returning to birth weight by 2 weeks, then gaining steadily
</div>

## Development

<div className="quick-only">
- Lifts head briefly during tummy time (a few seconds)
- Follows your face when you move slowly
- Calms to parent's voice or gentle touch
- Hands mostly clenched in fists
</div>

<div className="deep-only">
Motor development at 1 month centers on head control — still very limited, but you will see brief moments of lifting during tummy time. Always support the head when carrying.

Tummy time is essential even though your baby may protest. Start with 2-3 minutes several times a day on a firm surface. You can drape baby over your forearm or chest if floor tummy time triggers too much crying.

<TryTonight>When your baby is alert, slowly stick out your tongue toward them. Many 1-month-olds will imitate it after a moment. This is early social learning in action.</TryTonight>
</div>

## Safety and Environment

<div className="quick-only">
- Always place baby on their back to sleep, alone, on a firm flat surface
- Supervised tummy time only — never for sleep
- No soft bedding, bumpers, or pillows in the sleep space
- Keep the home smoke-free
- Never shake your baby
</div>

## When to Seek Advice

<SeekHelp>
Contact your pediatrician or family doctor if:

- Your baby shows no social smile by 2 months
- No response to sounds — does not startle to loud noises or quiet to your voice
- Poor feeding — fewer than 6 wet nappies per day, not back to birth weight by 2 weeks
- Baby appears floppy or very stiff in muscle tone
- Yellowing of skin or eyes not present at discharge
- You are struggling emotionally — postpartum mood disorders affect 1 in 5 parents and are treatable
